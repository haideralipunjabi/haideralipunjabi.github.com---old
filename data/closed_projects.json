                <p>
                    This website is hosted by PythonAnywhere, an online hosting
                    environment.  Something went wrong while trying to load it;
                    please try again later.
                </p>

                <div class="for-site-owner">
                    <h2>Debugging tips</h2>
                    <p>
                        If this is your PythonAnywhere-hosted site, and you just reloaded
                        it, then the problem might simply be that it hasn&#39;t loaded up yet.
                        Try refreshing this page and see if this message disappears.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you keep getting this message, you should check your site&#39;s
                        server and error logs for any messages &mdash; you can view them
                        from the Web tab inside PythonAnywhere.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If there&#39;s nothing in the logs, and you&#39;re sure your site is OK,
                        then it might be a problem on our side.  Drop us a line at
                        support@pythonanywhere.com, in the forums, or using the &quot;Send
                        feedback&quot; link on the site, quoting the error code below.
